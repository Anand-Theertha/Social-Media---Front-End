# Social Media Application 

In this description, we will be looking at a front end webpage built using ReactJS and Tailwind.css for a social media app. The app allows users to share posts, images, and other media with their friends and followers.

## User Interface

The user interface for the social media app built using ReactJS is designed to be simple, intuitive, and user-friendly. The main screen of the app displays a feed of posts from users that the current user is following. The feed is updated in real-time using websockets, allowing users to stay up-to-date with the latest content from their friends and followers.

The app's header contains a search bar, allowing users to search for posts and other content based on keywords or hashtags. The header also displays the user's profile picture, name, and a dropdown menu containing options such as "settings" and "logout."

The main content area of the app is divided into several sections. The left-hand side of the screen displays a list of the user's friends and followers, as well as suggested users to follow. Clicking on a user's name or profile picture opens their profile page.

The main content area also contains a section for creating new posts. Users can upload images or other media, write a caption, and tag other users or add hashtags. Posts can be shared publicly or with a select group of friends.
